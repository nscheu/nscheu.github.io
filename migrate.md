## about

I am deeply interested in creation.

Art and Engineering both consist of the formulation of an idea, the abstract, and the construction of a new reality where the abstract takes form.

Both music and technology retain a layer of abstraction, yet clearly exist, have a use, and affect the world we inhabit.

I love seeing abstraction become real.

I also enjoy gaming, especially survival and strategy games.
